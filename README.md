# Trim Layers To Keys

This After Effects script trims your layer in and out points based on the first and last keyframes on your layer. Simply select the layers you want to trim and run the script.

## Steps

2. Run the script from your favorite script launcher (e.g., Kbar) or launch it inside After Effects by navigating to:
   **File > Scripts > Run Script File**

## Script UI

This is a headless script (no panel).
